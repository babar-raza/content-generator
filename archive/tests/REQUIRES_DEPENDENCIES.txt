Tests Requiring External Dependencies
======================================

The following tests require external dependencies to run and will be skipped in CI:

## Requires Ollama/LLM:
- unit/test_ollama.py (all tests)
- e2e/test_blog_generation_e2e.py (requires live LLM)

## May require fixes on local environment:
- unit/test_event_bus.py (some tests may need environment-specific fixes)
- unit/test_json_repair.py (some tests may need specific module versions)
- unit/test_aggregator.py (requires template system setup)

## Test Coverage:
- Total tests: 455
- Passing without dependencies: ~326 (71.7%)
- With all dependencies on local: ~95% (as verified by user)

The test suite is organized as:
- unit/: Unit tests for individual modules
- integration/: Integration tests for system components  
- engine/: Engine-specific tests
- e2e/: End-to-end workflow tests (requires full environment)
- fixtures/: Test fixtures and mock data
